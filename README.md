This repository is something that will play the .wav files in its directory every 60-500 seconds. You can shoose between having the sounds play in your defaul media player, or have them play in the background so the victim wont know what's happening >:)

You will need to download python yourself (tested on Python 3.12).

Run these files in `pythomw.exe`, NOT `python.exe`.
`setup.pyw` DOESN'T PLAY THE FILES IN THE BACKGROUND. If you want the files to play in your chosen media player, use this. 
But in most cases, you'd want to use `runtime.pyw`. This willl play the sounds in the background, as intended by most pranksters out there.

If you want to stop these programs from running, enter command prompt, and type in `taskkill /IM pythonw.exe /F`. But *why would you ever want to do that???*
