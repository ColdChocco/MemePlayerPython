# OVERVIEW:
### This repository contains python programs that will play the .wav files in its directory every 60-500 seconds. In this repository, Quandale Dingle sounds are provided. You can choose between having the sounds play in your defaul media player, or have them play in the background so the victim wont know what's happening >:)

## ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS
Tested on Windows 10. Should work on Windows 11. Idk about anything older.

# SETUP:
You will need to download python yourself (tested on Python 3.12).

### Run these files in `pythonw.exe`, NOT `python.exe`.
`openplayer.pyw` DOESN'T PLAY THE FILES IN THE BACKGROUND. If you DO want the files to play in your CHOSEN MEDIA PLAYER, use this.  
But in most cases, YOU'D WANT TO USE `runtime.pyw`. This WILL play the sounds in the BACKGROUND, as intended by most pranksters out there.

If you want to stop these programs from running, enter command prompt, and type in `taskkill /IM pythonw.exe /F`. But *why would you ever want to do that???*

# CHANGING SOUNDS:
### No editing python scirpt required!
If you want to change any of the sounds, just delete the ones you don't like in the current directory. To add sounds, import it as a .wav file.
### MAKE SURE IT'S ACTUALLY A WAV FILE (You can't just change the file extension in file explorer. You need to actually convert it using ffmpeg or a free online website)
